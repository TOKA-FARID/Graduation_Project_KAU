## :wave: Introduction
The Deanship of Students Affairs Services Platform is a web-based solution designed to address the challenges faced by the Deanship of Student Affairs at King Abdulaziz University-Rabigh branch. This deanship plays a pivotal role in providing students with a diverse range of activities, including training courses, workshops, competitions, and trips. It also supervises various programs and support activities to enhance the educational experience at the university.

However, the Deanship encountered issues related to effectively reaching students with these activities and providing them with certificates of attendance. To bridge this gap and improve communication between the Deanship and students, this platform was developed.

## :rocket: Project Overview
The Deanship of Students Affairs Services Platform is a web application built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Its primary purpose is to centralize and streamline the delivery of Deanship activities to students. The platform offers a seamless experience for both students and Deanship staff, facilitating activity registration and certificate issuance.

## :dart: Project Goals

- Implement functionality for uploading, modifying, and deleting activities.
- Enable Deanship employees to access and manage activities efficiently.

### Objectives for Students

## :telescope: Scope
The project scope encompasses the following key features:
- Facilitating the delivery of Deanship activities to students.
- Allowing students to register for activities, cancel registrations, and obtain certificates of attendance.
- Providing administrative tools for the Deanship staff to manage and publish activities.

## :bulb: Significance of the Work
This platform will transform the work inside the Deanship from manual to digital. The Deanship currently uses manual methods for delivering their work, which has led to delivery problems. This platform simplifies the process of providing activities to students, including publishing course advertisements, registering for them, and obtaining certificates. A Supervisor can upload advertisements on the platform, modify or delete them, and the Trainer can upload the names of the attendees. The Supervisor can then download them to send certificates.
